# General issue information guidelines

### Context
Bug reports we get are very brief and vague - they often miss crucial information for which we have to ask the author and wait for the response. In the end this makes resolving the problem much more difficult and time consuming, which can be frustrating for both sides.
 
We propose these guidelines for bug reports and suggest treating them as requirements for bug reports created from now on.
 
### General suggestions
1 problem = 1 issue (don’t put several problems into one big issue)
 
### Details
Please make an effort and fill in the following sections - in most cases having this info is very important for us.

| Section | General (all issues)  | Website related  | Mobile app related  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Application** (website / iOS app / Android app)  | ✅ |   |   |
| **App version**  |   |   | ✅  |
| **System & browser** (name & version of both)  |   | ✅  |   |
| **Device used** type (mobile, tablet, desktop), model (iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy 8) | ✅  |   |   |
| **Date & time when bug was last noticed**  | ✅  |   |   |
| **Step-by-step scenario how to reproduce a bug** (perfectly with screenshot(s) )  | ✅  |   |   |
| **Desired behavior** (explain how it should work)  | ✅  |   |   |
